# AutoFlo

![AutoFlo Logo](docs/assets/autoflo-logo.png)

AutoFlo is an open-source platform that combines workflow automation with AI agent orchestration. It integrates n8n-style workflow automation with ActivePieces MCPs and Autogen Studio's AI agent capabilities, all unified with a React Flow visual interface.

## üöÄ Features

- **Visual Workflow Designer**: Create complex workflows with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- **AI Agent Integration**: Seamlessly incorporate AI agents from Autogen Studio into your workflows
- **280+ Service Connectors**: Leverage ActivePieces MCPs to connect to hundreds of external services
- **Hybrid Execution**: Combine traditional automation steps with AI agent capabilities
- **Extensible Architecture**: Build custom nodes, agents, and integrations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

AutoFlo consists of four main components:

1. **Frontend**: React-based UI with React Flow for visual workflow design
2. **Backend**: Node.js workflow engine with Python-based agent orchestration
3. **Integration Layer**: Adapters for ActivePieces MCPs and Autogen agents
4. **Storage Layer**: Persistent storage for workflows, configurations, and history

For more details, see the [Architecture Documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
